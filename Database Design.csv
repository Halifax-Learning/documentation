Design Explanation,Why don't we just combine QuestionType and TestType table into one table?,"Right now, there is an exact one-to-one relationship between table, so technically they can be combined into one. However, maybe in the future, there might be more than one test type that references a same question type, for example, Synthesis Short (10 questions) and Synthesis Long (20 questions) both refers to Synthesis question type.",,,,,
,Do we really need table AssessmentType?,"Right now there is only one assessment type, which we call ""Phonological Skills Assessment"", and which contains all 4 available test types. However, in the future, there might be more assessement types, such as an assessment containing only synthesis and analysis tests. So having this table now allows us more flexibility to extend if necessary.",,,,,
